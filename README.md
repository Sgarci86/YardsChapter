As urban areas grow in number and extent, urban plant diversity is becoming more important to understand 
and preserve. Urban plant communities provide ecosystem services to residents and habitat for many species 
of wildlife. Residential land may be especially important for plant diversity, as the amount of land and 
vegetation in private yards and gardens is often greater than the amount preserved as urban open space. 
Empirical studies have shown spatial autocorrelation in yard vegetation, with yards that are close together 
often being more similar than yards that are farther apart. These spatial patterns may have important implications 
for urban biodiversity. However, the drivers and outcomes of this spatial autocorrelation are still poorly 
understood. 
In this investigation, I use an agent-based model to study the drivers of spatial patterns in front-yard plant 
communities, and how those patterns affect biodiversity at multiple scales. I contrast the outcome of two potential 
drivers that operate at different scales: neighbor mimicry and neighborhood plant nurseries. Mimicry of yard 
vegetation between neighbors could alter plant communities within yards, potentially reducing variation in species 
composition between yards, and limiting plant diversity at larger scales. Neighborhood plant nurseries with different 
inventories could restrict residentsâ€™ ability to select the plants for their yards and create different kinds of 
spatial patterns. By comparing the spatial patterns produced by mimicry to the spatial patterns produced by nurseries, 
we can better understand the patterns we have observed in the field. This is particularly important when understanding 
how socio-ecological interactions can influence decision making and how it can disseminate throughout a community and
possibly a city landscape.  In this study, I found that spatial patterns are not created with mimicry alone as plant 
nurseries also play a role in front-yard management decisions. Expanding the model in the future will include the addition 
of socio-economic characteristics of each neighborhood, which may alter the species selection process and possible 
patterns of spatial autocorrelation at a larger scale.
